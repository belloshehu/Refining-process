# MODULAR REFINERY

Arduino code for implementing modular refinery to refine crude oil to four
products. These products are received in their respective storage tanks at their
respective distillation temperature range.

The products are:

- Naphthalene (from 40 to 170 degree celcius)
- Kerosene (from 170 to 250 degree celcius)
- Diesel (from 250 to 350 degree celcisu)
- Petrol (from 350 degree celcius and beyond)
